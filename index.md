### Background


### Introduction
Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by a persistently depressed mood or a loss of interest in activites, causing a significant impairment in patient's daily lives. While there are many potential causes of depression, the monoamine hypothesis predicts that the underlying pathophysologic basis of depression is a depletion in the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, such as serotonin, also known as 5-HT (Jesulola et al., 2018). A significant portion of the serotonin innervation to the forebrain comes from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the largest serotonergic nucleus in the brain, and it is known that Social Isolation Stress (SIS) renders DRN serotonergic neurons less responsive to stimulation (Sargin et al., 2016).
